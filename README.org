All the dotfiles are maintained in org-mode files as literate configuration. This was done in the hope that the different snippets can be understood and copied separately regardless of your own dotfiles solution. Feel free to browse through the different files and use whatever you like.

* Requirements

For installation you will need the following software installed already:

- ~make~
- ~emacs~
- one of the following:
  - ~guix~
  - ~stow~
  - ~rsync~

** Preparing the requirements on Windows

Here are some steps to be able to bootstrap the above tools:

1. Download the RefreshEnv.cmd from the Chocolatey Project to make editing the PATH variable quicker:
   [[https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/stable/src/chocolatey.resources/redirects/RefreshEnv.cmd]]
2. Download Zstd from the official repository, so that we can uncompress Msys2 packages:
   [[https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/latest]]
3. Add the Zstd folder to your users environment variables. Press Windows+R, and launch the following command to open up the environment variable editing window:

   #+begin_src shell
     rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables
   #+end_src

   Once you added it, use the RefreshEnv.cmd from step 2 to update the variables.

From this point onwards you have two options, either use MSYS2 or Cygwin packages. The difference between the two is that Cygwin aims to be an environment to simulate Unix, while MSYS2 packages are native Windows applications. A practical example of this is that the Cygwin packaged tmux only works if you launch it from the Cygwin packaged bash, but not from the MSYS2 packaged bash. Also Git for Windows is based on MSYS2 as well, so you might already have it installed.

*** MSYS2

1. Save time and effort by installing Git for Windows. This will get you a good base and some additional packages.
   [[https://gitforwindows.org/]]

2. Download the Make package with this command, all the dependencies are covered with Git for Windows:

   _NOTE_: there is a bug in curl 8.8.0, the below command will fail with an error message. Curl 8.7 and 8.9 are not affected.
   [[https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/13845]]

   #+begin_src shell
     curl -L -O -w '%{filename_effective}' https://mirror.msys2.org/msys/x86_64/make-4.4.1-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst | xargs tar -C ~/.local --zstd -xvf
   #+end_src

3. Download the Rsync packages with the following commands, all the other dependencies are covered with Git for Windows:

   #+begin_src shell
     curl -L -O -w '%{filename_effective}' https://mirror.msys2.org/msys/x86_64/rsync-3.3.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst | xargs tar -C ~/.local --zstd -xvf
     curl -L -O -w '%{filename_effective}' https://mirror.msys2.org/msys/x86_64/libxxhash-0.8.2-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst | xargs tar -C ~/.local --zstd -xvf
   #+end_src

*** Cygwin

Download and install the Cygwin, Gettext, Make packages with these commands:

#+begin_src shell
  mkdir -p ~/.local
  cd "$(mktemp -d)"
  export MIRROR='https://mirror.accum.se/mirror/cygwin/x86_64/release'
  curl -L -O -w '%{filename_effective}' "$MIRROR"/cygwin/cygwin-3.6.0-0.115.g579064bf4d40.tar.xz | xargs tar -C ~/.local -xvJf
  curl -L -O -w '%{filename_effective}' "$MIRROR"/gcc/libgcc1/libgcc1-13.2.1+20240203-0.1.tar.zst | xargs tar -C ~/.local --zstd -xvf
  curl -L -O -w '%{filename_effective}' "$MIRROR"/zstd/zstd-1.5.6-1.tar.zst | xargs tar -C ~/.local --zstd -xvf
  curl -L -O -w '%{filename_effective}' "$MIRROR"/zlib/zlib-1.3.1-1.tar.zst| xargs tar -C ~/.local --zstd -xvf

#+end_src

*** Known issues with Windows

**** Password prompts on MSYS2

If the password prompts are not showing up inside your Git Bash (MSYS2), eg. for the ~pass~ or ~passage~ programs, then you have two options:

1. The modern solution is to use the new [[https://github.com/microsoft/terminal][Microsoft Terminal]] which supports the new ConPTY pseudo console. Also make sure to have a new enough Git for Windows, and maybe try setting the ~MSYS=enable_pcon~ environment variable:
   https://github.com/mintty/wsltty/issues/271#issuecomment-1429789254
   This should be [[https://www.msys2.org/news/#2022-09-24-conpty-support-enabled-by-default][the default since September 2022]], but I also needed to set it manually.
2. The legacy solution is to use winpty:
   - [[https://superuser.com/a/1322277]].
   - https://gitforwindows.org/faq.html#some-native-console-programs-dont-work-when-run-from-git-bash-how-to-fix-it

   It is possible to force pipe redirection with the ~-Xallow-non-tty~ option, but in that case the text asking for the password will also be redirected to the pipe. So something like this:

   #+begin_src shell
     winpty -Xallow-non-tty age -p -a age-test >age-test.age
   #+end_src

   Will result in a file like this:

   #+begin_example
   Enter passphrase (leave empty to autogenerate a secure one):
   ←[F←[KConfirm passphrase:
   ←[F←[K-----BEGIN AGE ENCRYPTED FILE-----
   ...
   -----END AGE ENCRYPTED FILE-----
   #+end_example

**** Bash is running inside the default WSL distro instead of MSYS2 or Cygwin

If you install WSL, then Windows will put a ~bash.exe~ file inside the ~C:\Windows\System32~ folder. This folder is included in the system wide PATH environment variable, therefore it has the highest priority. So if you have a shell script with this shebang:

#+begin_src shell
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
#+end_src

Then the bash inside your default WSL distro will continue to execute the shell script, not the bash you installed with either MSYS2 (Git for Windows) or Cygwin.

Currently there is no option to remove the bash from System32:

https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/discussions/9681

MSYS2 and Cygwin are overriding these solutions, so make sure to launch the problematic programs from those shells. If you cannot do that, then make sure to launch the correct bash before the actual script, eg.:

this will not work:

#+begin_src shell
  $ which passage
  /c/Users/User/.local/bin/passage
  $ winpty passage --version
  winpty: error: cannot start 'passage': Not found in PATH
#+end_src

but this will:

#+begin_src shell
  $ which passage
  /c/Users/User/.local/bin/passage
  $ winpty bash passage --version
  ============================================
  =   passage: age-backed password manager   =
  =                                          =
  =                  v1.7.4                  =
  ...
#+end_src

** Preparing the requirements with Guix

If you already have ~guix~ installed on your system, then you can launch a shell with all of the required libraries with the following command:

#+begin_src shell
  guix shell --search-paths --manifest=manifest.scm
#+end_src

The repository also has a direnv config file, if you also have that, then the above command will be run for you whenever you step into the directory of the repository.

* Installation

You can compile the whole config by running ~make~ in the repository. The Makefile will run ~emacs~ to extract all the actual configuration files first, and then it will put them into the correct folder. If ~guix~ is found, then it will do a ~guix home reconfigure~. If ~guix~ is not found, then it will try to link the config files with ~stow~ or ~rsync~.

** Extracting the configuration files

You will need to start from an Emacs installation with org-mode configured. All the actual configuration files are stored in org-mode files and they need to be extracted into their own actual files.

#+begin_src shell
  emacs --batch --eval "(require 'org)" --eval '(org-babel-tangle-file "README.org")'
#+end_src

** Linking the configuration files

Once the configuration files are present in the ~build~ folder, then they can be linked to their final place inside the users home folder. If ~guix~ is installed, then the guix home will be reconfigured to install every package and link the configuration files as well. If not, then ~stow~ will symlink the files, if also stow is not found, then ~rsync~ will simply copy the files based on their modified time.

*** Guix home reconfiguration

Once the configuration files are extracted from the org-mode documentations, the Guix Home needs to be reconfigured.

#+begin_src shell
  guix home reconfigure -L build guix-home-config.scm
#+end_src

*** Stow linking

https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/

If ~guix~ cannot be found, then ~make~ will search for ~stow~. If it finds ~stow~, then it will link all the ~build/home~ files with it to the users actual home directory.

#+begin_src shell
  stow --no-folding --dir=./build --target ~/ home
#+end_src

*Note:* Stow can run under Windows, but the symbolic links created with Stow does not seem to work with the Windows version of Emacs. If you are on Windows use Rsync as described below.

*** Rsync copying

If neither ~guix~ nor ~stow~ can be found, then ~make~ will search for ~rsync~. If it finds ~rsync~, then it will copy all the ~build/home~ files to the users actual home directory.

#+begin_src shell
  rsync -avr build/home/ ~/
#+end_src

* Windows notes

The default folder for Emacs configuration in Windows is the ~AppData/Roaming~ folder. The dotfiles configuration will move them inside the usual ~~/.config/emacs~ folder. Because of this you need to launch Emacs with the following command:

#+begin_src shell
  runemacs --init-directory %USERPROFILE%/.config/emacs
#+end_src

Additionally the ~server-auth-dir~ will be set to the same value as the no-littering package would put it. So if you need to create a shortcut for emacsclient, you need to do it like this:

#+begin_src shell
  emacsclientw.exe --server-file %USERPROFILE%/.config/emacs/var/server/auth/server -r
#+end_src

* Future plans

** TODO Concat the org files inside Emacs

Currently the final org file is created with ~cat~, the order of the sections is kept due to the numbered filenames. There must be something better, eg. Algernon is using ~org-roam-list-files~:

https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/infrastructure.org/src/branch/main/tools/entangle.el

** TODO Make the gpg-agent.conf place customizable

The place of the ~gpg-agent.conf~ file is hard wired in the Guix home service to be inside ~$HOME/.gnupg~. It is possible to move this folder to an XDG compatible one, but the home service needs to be improved.
